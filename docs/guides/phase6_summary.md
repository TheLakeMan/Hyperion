# Phase 6 Highlights: Production Optimization

Welcome to the Phase 6 update! This release focuses on making Hyperion production-ready with deep observability, secure operations, and automated scaling. Here’s what’s new:

## 🎯 Key Themes

- **See everything**: Enhanced monitoring center with metrics, alerts, and log aggregation.
- **Stay secure**: Hardened web stack with API auth, rate limiting, and audit logging.
- **Ship confidently**: Deployment manager with plans, rollbacks, and health scoring.
- **Scale intelligently**: Policy-driven autoscaler for replica recommendations.

## 🔍 Observability & Monitoring

- `hyperionMonitoringCenter` aggregates counters/gauges/histograms and JSON exports.
- `/api/monitoring` endpoint shares metrics + logs for dashboards.
- `hyperion_cli monitor` command offers status snapshots, log tailing, resets, and alert management.
- Operations Playbook (`docs/guides/operations_playbook.md`) provides incident runbooks.

## 🔐 Security Hardening

- RFC-compliant WebSocket SHA-1/base64 handshake implementation.
- API key validation across headers, bearer tokens, and query params with constant-time comparison.
- Sliding-window IP rate limiting and warning logs (`security.*` metrics).
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) enabled by default.

## 🚀 Deployment & Rollbacks

- `hyperionDeploymentManager` computes plans, applies rollouts, and tracks history/health.
- CLI `deploy` command handles `plan`, `apply`, `rollback`, and `status`, emitting metrics/logs.
- `/api/health` endpoint exposes readiness data for load balancers and monitoring systems.

## 📈 Adaptive Autoscaling

- Configurable policy (thresholds, cooldowns, replica bounds) with live metric snapshots.
- `hyperion_cli autoscale plan` provides dry-run decisions before enacting changes.
- Autoscaler logs recommendations and updates monitoring counters for full auditability.

## 📚 New Docs & Tutorials

- **Operations Playbook**: Production readiness checklist & incident response steps.
- **Deployment & Autoscaling Tutorial**: End-to-end workflow under `docs/examples/deployment_autoscaling.md`.
- STATUS.md now tracks readiness progress for Phase 6 items.

## ✅ What’s Next

We’re finishing Phase 6 by:

1. Completing readiness checklist sign-offs per environment.
2. Publishing more examples and community guides leveraging monitoring + autoscale.
3. Preparing public release notes and deployment templates.

Thanks for building with Hyperion! Feedback is welcome via issues or discussions.
